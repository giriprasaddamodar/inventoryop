Basic Projects for Data Analyst Roles
1. Data Analyst - Operations, Supply Chain Management, and Logistics
Project: Inventory Optimization

Objective: Optimize inventory levels to reduce holding costs while ensuring product availability.

Steps:

Data Collection:

Collect historical sales data, lead times, and current inventory levels from the company's ERP system using SQL.
Gather supplier performance data.
sql
Copy code
SELECT product_id, sales_date, quantity_sold
FROM sales_data
WHERE sales_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
Data Cleaning and Analysis:

Use Python (Pandas) to clean and preprocess the data.
Calculate demand forecasts using statistical methods or time series analysis.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters import ExponentialSmoothing

df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
df['sales_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['sales_date'])
df.set_index('sales_date', inplace=True)

model = ExponentialSmoothing(df['quantity_sold'], seasonal='add', seasonal_periods=12)
fit_model = model.fit()
forecast = fit_model.forecast(12)
Visualization:

Use Power BI or Tableau to create a dashboard showing current inventory levels, forecasted demand, and recommended reorder points.
Project: Transportation Cost Analysis

Objective: Analyze and reduce transportation costs while maintaining delivery performance.

Steps:

Data Collection:

Extract transportation and delivery data, including costs, routes, and delivery times from the logistics database using SQL.
sql
Copy code
SELECT delivery_id, route, cost, delivery_time
FROM transportation_data
WHERE delivery_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
Data Cleaning and Analysis:

Clean and preprocess the data using Python.
Analyze cost per route and delivery performance.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
df['delivery_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['delivery_date'])
route_costs = df.groupby('route')['cost'].mean()
delivery_times = df.groupby('route')['delivery_time'].mean()
Visualization:

Create visualizations in Power BI or Tableau to compare costs and delivery performance across different routes.
